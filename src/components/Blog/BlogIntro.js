        <h1>Welcome to my Blog</h1>
        <p>
        This is part of an ongoing series based on the principle of 'learning in public'. I don't plan on writing anything particularly groundbreaking in the beginning, I just want to get in the habit of what I do for a living, what I'm learning, and what I find interesting. I plan on writing about, in no particular order, web development (in particular front end development), Blockchain technologies, including NFTs, the Metaverse, Machine Learning and AI generally. 
        </p>

        <p>As I gain more knowledge (and frankly confidence), I plan to write about books and articles I'm reading, perhaps providing reviews, and tech trends I find interesting (or troubling - we certainly have no shortage of that). </p>

        <p>For the moment, I plan on just throwing up articles as I write them, but soon I will add categories and tags, creating separate pages for each category. Then . . . commenting.</p>

        <p>I used to blog quite a bit, as was the trend in the late '00s and early '10s. Those good ole days when social media still allowed for things like small-fry bloggers such as me. When social media was still seen as a force for good. Oh, how naive we were. One of these blog still exists at: https://livefromtheheygate.blogspot.com/. For the other, I will eventually put up selected posts on my writing site at: https: timbeckett-writing.com. </p>
