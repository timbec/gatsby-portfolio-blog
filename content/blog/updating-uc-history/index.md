<!-- ## Updating the Uranium City History website -->

The website [Uranium City History]('https://uraniumcity-history.com') is the second site I built on my own (the first being my original portfolio site, built on Wordpress). I built it on Wordpress, which was a good choice at the time - Wordpress was at the height of its popularity pre-Gutenberg, and it had all the qualities of a CMS I needed to easily add and update content. 

The project was an outgrowth of my own attempt to make a documentary about Uranium City, Saskatchewan. I'd grown up in Uranium City in the '70s and early '80s, not long before its last mine abruptly closed in 1982, cutting the town's population by 90% in just a few months.
