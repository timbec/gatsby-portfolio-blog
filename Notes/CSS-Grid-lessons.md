Difficult to offset shapes off canvas using Grid, at least from what I've seen so far. 

using this as an example (Jonas course):

Need to use transforms to rotate (and even place) elements:

`transform: rotate(-20deg);`

To move elements off the page, look to `translate` property:

`transform: translate(-10rem, -10rem);`

To create illusion of images thrown on table:
